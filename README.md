# ML Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects developed by [Your Name].

## Projects

1. **Project Name 1**
-Description: This project aims to predict whether an underwater object detected by a sonar signal is a rock or a mine. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify sonar returns as either "R" (rock) or "M" (mine).
-Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas
-Dataset: The dataset used for training and testing is the "Copy of sonar data.csv" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
-Results:
-Training Accuracy: 83.42%
-Test Accuracy: 76.1%
-How to Run:
-Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-projects.git
-Navigate to the Sonar Prediction project directory: cd ml-projects/Sonar_Prediction
